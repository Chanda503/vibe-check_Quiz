## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This app is a playful web quiz designed to engage users in checking their vibe. Inspired by viral quizzes and real-time interactivity, the product delivers instant feedback with personality results and shareable outputs.

It was created using **LovableAI**, which helped scaffold and rapidly iterate on features. I then customized the UI, logic, and flow using React, Tailwind CSS, and other modern tools.
